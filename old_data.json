Beautifully described and wonderfully written, this story has characters that verge on being perfect. The characters hold this story together in a web of flaws, dreams, and hope in a way that is hard to match."

No, not yet. It wouldn't be right. She's clearly still upset about the possibility of us not making it out...Maybe later would be better. I looked back at her. \"There isn't much to tell. Obviously, waking up as Pokemon is terrifying.\"\r\n\r\nApril gave me an odd look. \"What's so bad about being a Pokemon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Er, that's not what I meant. All I'm saying is that I know I'm supposed to be a human. Randomly waking up as a different species would be scary, wouldn't it? Not to mention not being able to remember anything. Imagine if you woke up as a human and couldn't remember anything. You'd be freaked out, wouldn't you?\"\r\n\r\nApril nodded. \"I guess I see your point. Go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"So while I attempted to even just stand up in my strange new form, you showed up. At first, you actually kinda scared me, haha.\" I let out a small chuckle.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" April was giving me that odd look again.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I suppose I'm used to being taller.

I couldn't decide whether to tell her my feelings or not.\r\n\r\n\"But you what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Um, then I realized I wasn't so tall and that you were only as tall as me. I hadn't remembered all the Pokemon names at once, but I knew you were one of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh-huh. I know there's more than that...\" She looked at me with a serious gaze.\r\n\r\nWhat!? Am I really that transparent? Oh no, now what? I fumbled for words. \"Er, um, well you see, when I saw you...a-and that sparkle that you had on your coat...it-it\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh boy...why does this always happen? I had suspected as much. You like me, don't you? Like, you know, like me, like me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wha!? Er, um, uh, no, not at all! Well, uh, yeah. Yeah, I do...\" I was looking at the ground again. This isn't when I wanted to bring this up!\r\n\r\nApril sighed. \"I knew it...I've caught you just randomly staring at me. It looked like you were daydreaming. But you weren't. You were staring at me. Well, I suppose its to be expected. I am incredibly good-looking after all, teehee!\" She seemed happier. I thought that was odd.\r\n\r\nShe looked as if finding out made her upset. But...she's all giggly again. Could that mean? No, don't get your hopes. Arg! I can't believe it! What am I thinking!? How could I have let that feeling go crazy again? People...humans...aren't supposed to like Pokemon! But denying this feeling is getting harder and harder. I've got to turn back soon!\r\n\r\nI shook my head, clearing my thoughts. \"Look, April, it doesn't matter how I feel. That's the Pachirisu talking. I'm really a human. It would...it would never work out...\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean? You are the Pachirisu! At least, you are now!\"\r\n\r\n\"I just don't want to get all attached to you. In fact, it'd be worse for you if you became that way towards me. I'm still trying to turn back, remember? If I were to go back, this Pachirisu would be gone. I wouldn't be here. I'd be back with my friends, my family. As a human. And if you grew to like me...in that way...then imagine how hurt you'd be? I couldn't stand to do that to anyone. I just couldn't.\"\r\n\r\nApril was silent for a while. Then she put her paw on mine. \"Then don't. Stay with me instead. Imagine the adventures we could have together! Doesn't...doesn't that sound like fun?\" She was giving me a shy, sideways glance.\r\n\r\nI took my paw away. All of this was getting way too touchy-feely for my taste. \"No, please, don't do that to me. Just, stop. Stop it...Don't make me choose!\" What am I saying, of course I'd go home. I can't like a Pokemon!\r\n\r\n\"Shane! You're gonna have to decide eventually!\"\r\n\r\nI looked at her suddenly, confused. \"You...you called me Shane.\"",

      "detail": "“Praise God, ” he muttered. He then shook his head in dismay. “I never thought I’d praise God for a helmet…”\r\n\r\n“No god exists here. They have all abandoned us to slaughter…”\r\n\r\nPokulok whirled around to search for the voice. “Who’s there?” he snapped. He fumbled with his helmet before he slammed it over his head and attached it to his suit.\r\n\r\n“Nothing is here, ” the masculine voice said in a melancholy tone. “You know that. Why can’t you accept it?”\r\n\r\nThe MSE switched on the night vision and looked in the direction of the voice. A shape that had the vague silhouette of a large man was curled against the wall in a position more suited for a fetus. Otherwise, it was far too dark to see any features.\r\n\r\nPokulok gazed at the pitiful figure for a few seconds before he decided to ask the man a question. “What’s your name, sir?” he said in a hushed tone.\r\n\r\nThe man didn’t respond to his inquiry, which served to annoy the younger teen. “Sir?” Pokulok asked in a firmer tone.\r\n\r\nThe man still did not move and showed no indication that he had even heard the question. Anger surged through the MSE’s blood. This was pointless. Why should he risk his life for these people if they were going to be as useful as a sack of flour? He had no time left to waste; he had put his life and the lives of his Pokemon in danger for this man, and he needed an answer now.\r\n\r\n“Sir!” he spat furiously. The man flinched and looked up at him in fear. “Your name. What is it?”\r\n\r\nThe response was so small and weak that he almost couldn’t hear it. “M-Motris. Giror Motris.”\r\n\r\nThe MSE raised his eyebrows in response to the name. “Giror…Motris?” he repeated slowly. “Do you happen to be from Orre?”\r\n\r\nMotris lowered his head. “I don’t know.” He looked up again. “Who are you? Are you a crewmember?”\r\n\r\nThe teenager sighed. “My name is Claude Pokulok. I’m an MSE, and I’m going to get you and the rest of the crew out of he-”\r\n\r\n“No!” The MSE took a step back from the ferocity of the tone. “They’ll kill us if we try!”\r\n\r\nPokulok held his hands up defensively. “Okay, just calm down for a second. Let’s start from the beginning and tell me who you’re talking about. Is it the Revenant?”\r\n\r\nMotris wrung his hands in agitation, although he had thankfully stopped shouting. “I don’t know who they are, man, ” he mumbled. “I just know that they’ll kill us.”\r\n\r\nThe MSE stared in response. “That thing is going to find you in this room either way, ” he said, trying to make his voice sound calm. “We can walk out, and if you’re behind me every step of the way, I can promise that nothing will hurt y-”\r\n\r\n“No, you don’t know anything, man!” Motris interrupted, rising to his feet. He jabbed a finger at Pokulok’s chest. “You don’t know what they want. They want us, man! They want all of us!”\r\n\r\n“Yeah, I know it does. It’s a game to that monster, but I’m not going to do what it wants. If we stick together and-”\r\n\r\n“No, you’re wrong, man. They want us. They need us. You don’t know anything, man. Not a ****ing thing.”\r\n\r\n“So you’re just going to wait for the monster to come and kill you?” the teenager growled incredulously, trying to stop himself from screaming at the man’s idiocy. “That’s a pathetic way of thinking.” He took a deep breath to cool his temper down. “I intend to get out of here with my Pokemon, and you’re more than welcome to come along. I could definitely use your help to get out of this mess.”\r\n\r\n“No, man, we’ll never get out, ” Motris said with an air of finality. He sat down and folded his arms over his chest. “You can’t beat them, ma-”\r\n\r\n“Goddammit, have you been paying any attention to anything I’ve said?!” Pokulok howled, finally losing his patience. “I don’t give a flying **** about what you think! I put my Pokemon’s lives at risk for you, you pessimistic son of a *****! I left them alone in the hangar of this ****ing ship to save you!”\r\n\r\nThe man shuddered. “I-I can’t, man, ” he said. “The spawn will kill us if we go out…”\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s too bad for you, ” the MSE snarled, firmly grabbing Motris by the arm. He involuntarily shivered at the icy-cold touch. “We are going out of this room, and there’s not a damned thing you can do about it. I’m in charge of this situation, and we’re getting out of this hellhole alive. You have one of two choices: you can get on your ****ing feet and walk out of here on your own power or I will drag you out myself, even if you’re kicking and screaming. But you will go out of this room, and I will not allow you to impede my progress. Do – I – make – myself – clear?”\r\n\r\nAfter a few seconds, the man quietly nodded. Pokulok then realized that something that Motris had said seemed hauntingly familiar, especially after recalling Harris’ last moments.\r\n\r\n“Giror, you said something about the ‘spawn’ killing us, ” he said, making sure that his tone wouldn’t provoke the older man further. “What are the spawn?”\r\n\r\nMotris glanced from side to side, almost as if he was afraid of a person overhearing the conversation. “Part of them, ” he said simply.\r\n\r\nThe teenager bit his lip in frustration. The information wasn’t nearly good enough to go on, but he knew that if he pushed the man any more than he had, he risked losing him for good.\r\n\r\n“Alright, ” Pokulok murmured, turning toward Motris. “Now that we have that settled, do you know a way out of this room?”\r\n\r\nThe older man pointed at a metal door that the MSE had not noticed earlier. An emotion that was eerily similar to paranoia had started to dig its way into his brain, and it took the last bit of his courage to force it down.\r\n\r\n“Okay, let’s get out of here, ” Pokulok said in resignation. He walked toward the door, opened it, and nearly jumped out of his skin when he saw what was behind it.\r\n\r\nHe was back in the hangar, and his Pokemon were ten yards away, staring at him in horror.\r\n\r\n“Deifir! Faitios!” He rushed over to them and embraced them tightly. “God, you had me worried. Let’s get out of here; I’ve seen enough to last…”\r\n\r\nThe teenager trailed off when he felt them trembling. He looked into their faces and saw the terror in both of their eyes – terror that was not aimed at him. He didn’t even need to turn around to know that he had been duped by the Revenant again. The pieces – an ungodly mudslide of clues he had missed and hints he had failed to see – had suddenly fallen into place with cruel precision.\r\n\r\nI was a fool! It put the name right in front of me, and I still couldn’t see it! Giror Motris…Rigor mortis…\r\n\r\n“****, ” he muttered despairingly, whirling around and drawing his pistol after hearing an unearthly screech. The entity known as Giror Motris was roaring in agony as its human form slowly dissolved. Its melting eyes met Pokulok’s with a glare of utter loathing as the rest of its body continued its hideous transformation into shadow and tar.\r\n\r\n“****!” The MSE raised his pistol and fired at the monster until the magazine had been emptied. However, it didn’t seem to faze the creature. After realizing that he was out of bullets, he fumbled with ejecting the empty clip, wasting too many precious seconds. He made the mistake of looking up and saw that the monster was shambling toward him with surprising speed. He took out a new clip and tried to load it into the pistol. In his terror, it slipped out of his grasp and clattered to the floor.\r\n\r\nThe teenager let out several obscenities and dove toward his ammo. He managed to snag the magazine with one hand, but the monster had reached him slightly afterward. It grabbed him by the throat with both of its clawed hands and raised him into the air. He thought that it looked up at him, but without its eyes, mouth, or nose, it was almost impossible to truly tell – until its face split into four and bellowed at him, revealing a jumbled mess of distorted facial features behind the mask.\r\n\r\nThe teenager kicked at it and thrashed around, but nothing seemed to break its grip. He was about to give up hope when he remembered that he still had his gun. He felt a strange sense of calm guide him as he loaded the gun, pulled back the hammer, aimed at the monster’s head, and fired six point-blank shots. It let out a bloodcurdling screech and immediately dropped him while it staggered and fell on its back. It melted through the ground as it hit the floor, leaving nothing behind.\r\n\r\nPokulok lay where he fell and breathed rapidly. He was exhausted beyond measure, but as he remembered his Pokemon, he realized that they needed him to be strong. He rolled onto his stomach and slowly got up, gasping at the effort. He stumbled to their side and immediately fell down again. He looked at them and forced a smile on his face, but it quickly faded when they didn’t return the favor. Instead, Faitios sobbed unashamedly into Deifir’s shoulder, while the normally-confident Absol had a defeated look on his face and didn’t even try to comfort the Skarmory. He felt a pang of sorrow hit him as he realized the enormity of what had just happened.\r\n\r\nThe Revenant lied. There were no hostages. It turned the crew into monsters like itself…\r\n\r\nThe MSE was interrupted by the cacophony of familiar laughter. He looked around and noticed the spawn phase through the walls with cruel laughs of their own. His Pokemon let out cries of panic and fled through the door he had come through.\r\n\r\n“No, wait!” the teenager shouted, quickly leaping to his feet and giving chase. “Come back!” He ran at the door, but it slammed shut and locked itself on him as if it were possessed. He kicked the door open, walked through, and immediately shut it on the advancing horde.\r\n\r\nThe scenery had undergone a complete metamorphosis from when he last saw it; it had changed from a tiny room devoid of light to a balcony with a large brightly-lit room below him. Pokulok scanned the room and caught sight of Deifir and Faitios on the lower level, trying to get another door open. He immediately rushed to the edge of the balcony, opening his mouth to yell their names. He never got the chance.\r\n\r\nHe barely felt the subtle shift of his feet leaving the ground. He couldn’t force a scream out of his throat as he twisted his body to lessen the impact. He didn’t even try to fight off the darkness when he hit the ground. The last thought that came to his mind before he slipped into unconsciousness was that he had failed his mission and his friends.",

      "detail": "Sai was quiet, then he spoke after a few moments: “Do you want to be closer to me or something? Are you feeling like the others are getting more attention or something? I didn’t know. You should have told me.”\r\n\r\nI looked up, caught off guard. “N-No, that’s not—”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know how to be close to people. Or pokémon, for that matter, ” he said solemnly, ignoring me. “I’m not allowed to be close to anyone, so it’s fine. I guess. But if that’s what you want…”\r\n\r\nI waited for him to go on, but he didn’t. He looked at me, his dark blue eyes full of sadness. The panic that he was in at the radio tower had vanished.\r\n\r\nHe went over to the bed and started rummaging through his backpack. He pulled out a marker, which I didn’t even know he had. It made me think that there was no end to the amount of things in his backpack, just like there was no end to the things to the radio.\r\n\r\n“I use it to practice writing sometimes, ” he said. “I don’t know what to do. It might sound weird, I know. I don’t know. We can share a secret about each other, all right? You share one secret, and I’ll share one of mine. You can read my secret, but I won’t read yours. You can write it on my back, and I’ll write yours on a piece of paper, since you don’t wear shirts.”\r\n\r\n“Um, ” was all I could think to say. A secret? About me? About my trainer? I had mixed feelings, as I usually did. I had never told anyone a secret about me since I was too shy. But it would be nice to know my trainer a bit more, and maybe it could help me make my decision…\r\n\r\n“This could make us feel closer, you know? Since that’s what you want, ” Sai went on. He went over to the table in the corner of the room, and picked up the piece of paper that had been lying there since the day we rented out the room. It had all of the pokémon center’s housing rules on it, but he took the marker and wrote over the words. Soon, I would be able to read those words, whatever they were. I noted that it took him a long time to write, as if writing each letter was agonizing for him.\r\n\r\nWhen he was done, he took off his shirt. Since Earl had always told me I shouldn’t look at his body out of self-consciousness, I turned to look away from Sai as well. But then Sai came closer to me and bent down, making it hard to not see him. He handed me the marker and nodded.\r\n\r\n“This is…” I said, trailing off. I didn’t know how to put it. It was weird, writing on a human’s back, was it not? Would it stay there forever? What if someone else saw? Couldn’t I just not write a secret, and Sai would never know?\r\n\r\nBut Sai seemed so calm compared to his panicky demeanor at the radio tower. I wanted to keep him calm. So I took the marker and wrote on his back as quickly as I could to get the awkwardness over with. I didn’t even have to think about what I wrote: I wish I was human.\r\n\r\nYes, I did wish I was a human. If I were human, I would do my absolute best to get rid of my shy demeanor. I’d travel the entire world, see what each city and town had to offer. I’d meet all the great kinds of people out there, and all the terrible kinds of people, too. I wouldn’t have pokémon to protect me; I’d protect myself. And as I traveled, I’d find out what I wanted to do with the rest of my life.\r\n\r\nI wished the same for Sai.\r\n\r\nI had believed that I had done a good job of finally forcing myself to do something I wanted in life. I had believed that I was doing a good thing for Sai by showing him around the city, proving to him that there was more to like than the pokémon that constantly followed him around. Perhaps I had been wrong, because now he was being paranoid. Now he seemed to be crazy again, thinking someone was stalking him, watching his every move. This seemed completely illogical to me, but there was nothing I could say to prove it to him. All I could think was that, at the end of the day, his life revolved around this journey for the gym badges. To him, there was nothing else, and though it bothered me, I couldn’t change him. His emotions and passion were fierce, his eyes set on one goal and one goal only. Still, I would wait out my decision. It wasn’t anything that I had to declare right now, and truthfully, I was afraid of deciding, anyway.",

He had chosen Zweilous in the first place because it was his most recent capture, having been acquired as a young Deino shortly before his participation in the Pokemon League. Knowing this, Zweilous was easily the least experienced of Evan’s Pokemon, but he had apparently underestimated its sheer power.\r\n\r\n“You may have beaten me, ” Officer Jenny growled, “but you won’t get away! I’ll lock down the station, and—”\r\n\r\nA sharp bang cut her off.\r\n\r\nOfficer Jenny coughed, splattering a red stain on her uniform.\r\n\r\nThe life vanished from her eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd she fell to the floor.\r\n\r\n“Whuh—What the hell?!” Evan cried, rushing to Officer Jenny’s side. He found a hole in her back. “What the hell just—”\r\n\r\n“That would be my handiwork, ” Lunaris said, returning with a smoking gun in his hand, “though I'll admit that it’s not my best.”\r\n\r\n“Did…did you…?” Evan stammered.\r\n\r\n“I did, ” Lunaris said with a disturbingly casual tone in his voice. “Leaving her alive would have made her quite a nuisance. Now, I have my things, including the Pokemon I want to present to Team Rocket. Shall we take our leave?”\r\n\r\nEvan hesitated. He put a finger to his ear.\r\n\r\n“We’re ready for pickup, ” Evan said, the cockiness in his voice completely gone.\r\n\r\n“Roger, ” the pilot said back.\r\n\r\nEvan’s finger fell out of his ear as the rest of his arm dangled limply at his side. Lunaris left, leaving Officer Jenny’s corpse behind to rot. Only one thought ran through Evan’s mind.\r\n\r\nThis wasn’t how it was supposed to be.",

The next thing I knew, I'd turned and saw him at the centre of a ring of old folks, their eyes all fixed hungrily on his jigsaw.\r\n\r\n“Come on!” I cried back. “Push on!”\r\n\r\nOne of the old people lashed out at him with a walking stick; he ducked it, put the jigsaw inside his coat and drew out what appeared to be a rapier from his pocket.\r\n\r\n“Go on without me!” he replied, parrying a second blow and slashing at an old woman's snatching hand. “I'll keep them busy!”\r\n\r\n“But your niece—!”\r\n\r\n“She has parents – they can buy her presents.” His blade was a blur, flickering from point to point around the circle as the encircling elderly attacked. “Go!”\r\n\r\n“But—”\r\n\r\n“Go!”\r\n\r\nHe turned to look at me, and it was that momentary lapse of concentration that was his undoing. Someone released a Jack-in-the-box from a shelf into his hand; the Jack's pointy hat jabbed his thumb and he dropped his sword with a yelp. A moment later, he was just a face between the clawing hands of the old people, screaming wildly; a few seconds later, he had vanished entirely in a swell of cardigans and wrinkled skin.\r\n\r\n“No!”\r\n\r\nI lashed out at the nearest old person with my pipe, but I was shoved aside; I was no match for five of them at once. There was nothing more I could do, and if I stood still I would be crushed – so I left the thin man and ran for the Lego.\r\n\r\nAs I got close, I noticed a man on his hands and knees, searching for something on the bottom shelf; I stepped onto his back and jumped off without breaking stride, crashing into the top of the shelves where the Lego was and snatching up the boxes mid-leap. Toys, pieces of wood and one teenager with an armful of Lego rained down on the unfortunates on the other side of the shelf; thankfully, I landed on a fat man's belly, bounced off and kept running. One woman watched me open-mouthed, and shouted in a high, keening wail:\r\n\r\n“He's got Lego!”",

Her Arcanine must have had the Intimidate ability, which cut the strength of any attacker it encountered.\r\n\r\n“Crap, gonna Intimidate us, is that it?” Spencer mumbled through gritted teeth. “Time for ranged moves, then…Typhlosion, Arcanine! Flamethrower!”\r\n\r\nSimultaneous blasts of fire flew down the hill, striking the other Arcanine right in its front. It snarled as it took the assaults, noticeably affected by them despite its natural resistance to fire. But then suddenly flames were scattered everywhere as a tan horse jumped in the way of the blaze, glowing with a fiery sheen—it didn’t seem to even notice that it was being hit. In fact, the flames of its mane and tail only intensified.\r\n\r\n“Did that just make it stronger?! Oh crap, it must have Flash Fire. Typhlosion, stop the Flamethrower and use Dig!

All he knew was that if someone was to happen to Zerobi now, he would…\r\n\r\n\"… Zerobi…?\" Lucario slowly asked, patting the shoulder of his partner.\r\n\r\nIn an instant she spun around with a claw outstretched, cutting through his throat with a quick slash. Blood splayed across the field as time seemed to stop all around them. Pain filled Lucario's head while a gargling sound escaped his throat as he tried to draw breath, but the passageway to his lungs had been completely severed and he began choking instead. He felt his warm blood running the fur on his neck, holding up a hand in a futile attempt of stopping the flow. Falling to his knees from the lack of air, all he could do was stare deeply into the eyes of the smiling Weavile in front of him.\r\n\r\nInside of them, he noticed that there was something unusual.\r\n\r\nNothing.",

The last time I found myself on a train at random, I ended up in City 17. And I ain't no Free Man, so you can guess how that went. Pigzie Doodle sighed. I do realise you can't hear me, but I also find it hard to stop talking. Centuries of travelling alone does that to a person. Anyway, did I ever tell you about Mombasa?

Who are you calling a kid!?” Sera seemed a bit offended by the Parasect’s remark.\r\n\r\n“The mushroom is merely making the observation that you two are too inexperienced for a mission like this, ” he responded.\r\n\r\n“Cordy? You coming?” a somewhat deep, but still feminine voice called out.

Likewise, I could have taught them many things.\r\n\r\nI could have taught them how there are many ways to end a life, making such a sacred concept even more fragile than expected and desired.\r\n\r\nThere could be a simple snap of the neck. A disease whose only desire is to determine the day that you die. A pokémon attack gone awry and fired in all the wrong directions at all the wrong people. There could be the pull of a trigger and bullets that move faster than air itself, the same air that goes through so much trouble to place people in the gun's path, only to abandon them and watch them rot.\r\n\r\nLet it not be forgotten that your current pokémon are causing the same kind of mayhem as I am, the same kind of carnage—and perhaps even more, though you will never know or dare to ask—as you yearn for their touch, their voices, any sign of propinquity.\r\n\r\nLet it not be forgotten that blood—though you despise me for wanting it so much—is exactly what keeps both of you alive and breathing and together.\r\n\r\nLet it not be forgotten that you are trying to live in a world that can offer you nothing but misery not meant for someone so young, a constant fight against insanity, and a skeptical view on what it means to be happy.\r\n\r\nLet it not be forgotten that you made me this way.\r\n\r\nDoes that bother you, baby?\r\n\r\nBaby?\r\n\r\nWhy aren’t you screaming anymore?\r\n\r\nYour pokémon have run. Aren’t they supposed to be loyal? I would have been loyal to you.\r\n\r\nBaby?",

      "detail": "Your face can’t form expressions like a human can, but I can see anyway in the slight tilt of your head, the twitching of your antennae, the slight slowing of your wing flaps, that it takes you a moment to recognize me. That wrenches at my heart more than anything; suddenly it occurs to me that your sense of time on the PC was muddled, that your first realization of how long it’s been is seeing me suddenly a teenager in place of the child that you knew. You hover there silently for a second, just staring at me with those unblinking red compound eyes; I don’t know if the accusation I see in them is real or just a projection of my own guilt. I try to imagine what must be going through your mind, what it might feel like to realize you’ve been in stasis for years, that everyone you knew has moved on without you – but I can’t even begin to comprehend it.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry, Butterfree, ” I whisper; my voice is hoarse, and as I say it, as that pathetic apology escapes my lips as if it could ever make up for it, tears start pricking at the corners of my eyes. “I should have done this so long ago.”\r\n\r\nIt’s painful to speak, so I point the ball back at you and press the button, showing you that nothing happens, that I’ve deactivated the Pokéball. I throw it away; it bounces off the ground and comes to a rest by the roadside. You stare at it for a second, then look back at me.\r\n\r\n“I kept telling myself I’d keep training you, ” I say, fighting the urge to avert my eyes, the feeling that I don’t have any right to look at you anymore (I don’t, but this whole time I’ve been refusing to face you, and I can’t do that anymore). “And I never did. I released the others I couldn’t get the chance to continue training, so they could move on and have a life, but not you. I could never accept that you’d be better off without me. But you would.”\r\n\r\nYou look at me for a moment more, and then you flutter upwards, circling a few times in the sky for the first time in six years – six years that you never even knew. I try to swallow the lump in my throat, but I can’t; my mind is full of every time I avoided using you, every time I put off training you, every time I remembered you and realized I hadn’t thought about you for weeks. It’s an aching, suffocating feeling of opportunities lost, potential wasted and friendship neglected.",

It did not experience pain, merely dissatisfaction at this unscheduled delay. It began to turn its gaze skyward but was blasted downward by the invisible force again, crashing deep below the ocean surface. It aligned itself and looked toward the surface venomously. This disruption was only giving its quarry more time to escape.\r\n\r\nThe murderer closed its eyes, sensing the world around it. Suddenly it felt a massive power speeding towards it, almost as fast as light. It opened its eyes, allowing power to surge through it, and an explosion of pure power enveloped the killer's frame, atomising the water into its base components. It could sense its foe flying away rapidly to avoid the deadly energy.\r\n\r\nThe killer rose to avoid the resurgence of the water, looking skyward to its aggressor. The murderer's eye's widened slightly in surprise. The killer's attacker saw this minute shift in facial expression and changed shape.\r\n\r\nOrange skin started to crawl over its grey legs and body, causing them to grow thicker and leaving only a small, spiked, blue strip on each of its knees. The large, turquoise and orange oblong melted into its head, the flesh reworking itself like wax to form a three-pronged mask. As well as this each thin tentacle split at the tip, the two sides peeling down the tentacle until there were two formed, one turquoise and one orange on each side. The only space left unchanged was the dark purple orb in its chest, twinkling even in the lack of sunlight.\r\n\r\nIn the split second this transformation took place, the creature lunged toward the killer, wasting no time in executing blows which could have levelled a continent. But this time the killer was ready. With each attack the air shook and thunder rolled, but the killer stayed motionless, absorbing the onslaught without so much as a blink.\r\n\r\nAnd then the killer struck back.",

I was fine last time and the time before that! Get off my back about it!”\r\n\r\n“Ala!” Alakazam exclaimed, taking a step closer.\r\n\r\n“Of course not! Besides that, it’s something that I want to do. Its only ever helped us anyway.”\r\n\r\n“Kazam, zam ala.”\r\n\r\n“Oh screw you! You’ve been with me every step of the way. You can’t just spring these complaints on me out of nowhere. If you have a problem with something I’m doing, then say something right then. Don’t just spring it on me out of nowhere when the situation has passed. You do this all the time!”\r\n\r\n“Kazamam!” his Pokemon challenged.\r\n\r\n“I don’t have to ask for your permission! I involve you in my decisions because I love you! I’ve never led any of you into anything we couldn’t handle and I’m not about to start! Let it go!”\r\n\r\n“Kazam!” Alakazam accused, baring his small teeth.\r\n\r\n“Shut up, ” Ethan hissed, roughly shoving his Pokemon backwards.\r\n\r\n“Ala!” his Pokemon yelled. As the sound left his lips, the psychic Pokemon flexed his right hand, calling an orb of psychic energy to hover above his palm. The ball gyrated quickly, eager to be released. The colors thrummed from purple to black, with grey streaks swirling around its center.\r\n\r\n“Do it, ” Ethan whispered, grabbing his Pokemon’s hand.\r\n\r\n“Kazam, ” his Pokemon replied.\r\n\r\n“Come on, do it, ” Ethan said, egging the Pokemon on.\r\n\r\n“Alakazam.”\r\n\r\n“You lack the courage of your convictions, ” Ethan accused, shoving his face into the swirling ball of energy.\r\n\r\n“KAZAM!”\r\n\r\nAs Ethan’s faced grazed the exterior of the ball, his flesh began to fester and burn, quickly bypassing first degree and going straight to third. His Alakazam quickly ended the flow of power feeding the orb’s energy, effectively saving his master from further injury. The attack had broiled the lower half of his face, making him quickly reel backwards in pain. He stumbled backwards, his hands reaching up in reflex to put pressure on the wound.\r\n\r\nHe watched Alakazam approach, his eyes beginning to tear with worry. The pain he felt vanished instantly as he took a breath and centered himself; the flakes were already doing their work. As he continued to breathe, the burned and ruined flesh on his face evaporated in a stream of black smoke, being replaced by the tan, flawless skin that had been there before. Reaching up again, he felt his unblemished skin stretch itself tight across his chin.\r\n\r\nLooking at his Alakazam, he stated, “That’s why we do this. This is why we’re out here.”\r\n\r\n“Kazam, ” his Pokemon lamented.\r\n\r\n“I do value your opinion, but we agreed on this a long time ago.”\r\n\r\nAlakazam just stared at him.\r\n\r\n“And you will not mention that incident again. Do you understand?”\r\n\r\n“Kazam, ” his Pokemon nodded.\r\n\r\nEthan walked away, the gravel crunching delightfully under his boots.",

He was with their Pokemon, and his mind was blank.\r\n\r\n“Duduck, ” Golduck stated, tapping him on the shoulder.\r\n\r\nDorian turned, vaguely aware that the rock type Pokemon around them were rushing forward.

He placed Shelton in Dorian’s arms, pushing her against him to make sure he had a strong grip.\r\n\r\nFaster than Dorian could think, he, Shelton, and their Pokemon were yanked upwards and shoved to the right, high above the incoming stampede of rock Pokemon. They flew through the air, being guided by Golduck’s formidable mind. Dorian saw everything, he felt all of it. His group was guided into the crater the earlier explosion had made, being pushed tenderly out of harm’s way.\r\n\r\nJust before they passed below the lip of the crater, Dorian saw the rock Pokemon race towards Golduck, he saw the mauve energy around Golduck flare brightly as they reached him, and as the first attack connected, he saw the sapphire Pokemon explode.",

I win through forfeit, ” he whispered. “Now I, as required by the League, have to mug you.”\r\n\r\n“Wait wait wait wait!” exclaimed Death, reappearing in front of Zub, donning a pair of what appeared to be Pikachu ears.. “I’m a Pokémon! I’m Pikachu!” Realizing his mistake, he changed his brilliantly balck robe into an outfit resembling a Pikachu. “Pika pika, ” he added helpfully.\r\n\r\nThe man’s eyes lit up once more. “A POGEYMAN! AND IT IS CUUU~UTE!” groping his belt for his Pokéball, he promptly threw it, releasing a Magikarp.\r\n\r\n“Oo, this’ll be fun!” exclaimed Zub’s ‘Pikachu’. “Especially after he called me ‘cute’.”\r\n\r\n“EXCELLENT!” said their opponent giddily. “MAGIKARP, USE YOUR ♥FANTABULOUS♥ SPLASH ATTACK!”\r\n\r\nThe Magikarp’s eyes narrowed. Lightning and thunder struck from a distance. The fish Pokémon rose up into the sky, blue streams of light flowing over it. More lightning.\r\n\r\nDeath whistled. “Our special effects guy better not blow the budget on this fish.”\r\n\r\nMagikarp, faster than a speeding Remoraid, sped to Death, unleashing its ultimate attack….\r\n\r\nMagikarp flailed a little bit, then fell over on the ground, gasping for air. Death gave a confused glance over to Zub, then punted Magikarp away, instantly defeating it.\r\n\r\n“HYOOOOOOOI!” screamed their opponent, doubling over as if he was hit in the groin with something heavy. “MY POGEYMAN!”\r\n\r\n“Do we win?” asked Death in a nonchalant manner.\r\n\r\n“NO!” screamed the man. “I HAVE FIVE MORE OF THESE THINGS!”\r\n\r\nDeath frowned. After a moment of thinking, he came up with a solution. “Would you like a hug from this ADOWABLE Pikachu?”\r\n“Boy howdy!” shouted the man, and ran up to hug Death, where he dropped dead.\r\n\r\n“There we go, ” said Death , grabbing the man’s remaining Pokeballs. “Who’s up for grilled fish for dinner?”",

He described the nature of the weapon and it’s purpose, much to Koga’ shock and delight. Blaine then described the mission and how the weapon would be put to use. Koga was visibly excited with this news and this very much annoyed Blaine. He found Koga a disgusting specimen of a human being. A man who takes pleasure out of killing is a warped and twisted man thought Blaine, as Koga excitedly began preparing for the mission.\r\n\r\n“How can you sleep at night?” Blaine asked.\r\n\r\n“Ha, you’re disgusted by me, aren’t you?” Koga said, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Yes. You’re a ninja. A man who kills people under the disguise of shadows and darkness. How is that honourable?”\r\n\r\n“And yet, you’re a scientist. A man who kills people under the disguise of knowledge and discovery. You are no different to me.”\r\n\r\n“What on earth do you mean?” Blaine suddenly yelled.\r\n\r\n“The weapon I’m going to use in this mission. I may be the one using it but you are the one who created it. If you made the gun, you are no better than the man who pulls the trigger.”",

      "detail": "Seeker decided to leave the cave too and fly into the icy winds. As she'd come up slower than when she'd tried before, her body wasn't working as hard to keep up with the thin cold air. Maybe that was the secret, to get used to the thin air little by little. But then how long would it take to fully break through the sky?\r\n\r\nFinding a rock jutting out of a wall, she landed there and listened around her. Not that far below her, Cyrus had already found a fight for Sneasel in a snover. Gyarados was complaining about the cold and ice, while Murkrow was suddenly hyper and energetic, fluttering around the group. However, Cyrus didn't feel anything for them, not even annoyance. They were like parts of his machines: not as important as the whole, just things to use. Did he feel the same for her?\r\n\r\nNo, definitely not. He had been pleased with her at least once, and he allowed concern to lead him to throw a battle rather than knock her out. Maybe she had just been a part of his designs once, but Seeker was pretty sure that she was more important to him than that now. He just didn't let those feelings and thoughts rise above his internal defenses.\r\n\r\nThe sky was full of moisture, in the form of snow and clouds. There were more clouds overhead, so it wasn't a time she'd usually try to fly into the sky. Then again, what if the presence of all that moisture helped her? She would have a full radar view of the air around her and could notice something unusual. Maybe she could succeed now.\r\n\r\nEven as she thought of it, she had to wonder why. Why did she want to go through to the other side of the sky? It was just curiosity at first, to know what was there. And then it was because she had always failed and hoped that she might just make it this time. But then, what was the point of it? Whatever was on the other side of the sky... it didn't matter. And it didn't matter because Cyrus was on this side of the sky.\r\n\r\nIt was her dream, but it didn't really matter. Only what Cyrus wanted mattered. Even if he wanted to replace her, it didn't matter. It was okay.\r\n\r\nThere was a tinge of sadness when she thought of that, but that passed away into numbness quickly. It was a relief to think that she didn't need to worry about what her goals should be, because they'd end up passed over in favor of his goals anyhow. As long as she was near him, she was... happy wasn't quite the right term for it. Content. It wouldn't matter if there was silence or noise around her. When she heard him and knew his thoughts, she would know what to do. Even if her own heart was silent.\r\n\r\nAnd that turned out to be the breakthrough she needed.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later, Cyrus had the other two members of his team evolved. They had sounded pleased, but hopeful that he might let them go soon if he didn't feel anything for them. Seeker wasn't bothered by this. He still had some use for them, so she would tolerate their foolishness. Once they had been recalled, she flew over to meet with him.\r\n\r\n“A little late for the effect I wanted in having a crobat, ” he said, reaching over to rub her ear while she hovered by him. “But good. It proves the falseness of what was believed.” And he smiled.",

      "detail": "Bill opened his mouth, but without warning, Adam interrupted him.\r\n\r\nSomething about her seems familiar. Ask her if she is the advisor to the empress.\r\n\r\nAlthough he had no idea where Adam was going with this, Bill knew he had nothing to lose if he followed. After all, either way, he knew that he would be fighting this ixodida and potentially the army she had amassed behind him. The question was when. Straightening his back as much as he could, he took a deep breath and spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Are you the advisor to the empress?\"\r\n\r\nPandora lifted her head. \"I am and always will be. My loyalty to Her Majesty is limitless, and it is my pleasure to serve her through my wisdom and abilities.\"\r\n\r\nLong-winded as ever. I know this creature. Bill, you must tell her to deliver a message to her empress.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" Bill whispered.\r\n\r\nJust trust me.\r\n\r\n\"I really hope this doesn't end badly.\"\r\n\r\nIt will end favorably for us, no matter what happens.\r\n\r\nBill exhaled. A strange feeling of dread crept into him, but knowing how large of an army was behind him and how powerful the ixodida were, he once again realized it wouldn't exactly hurt him to follow Adam's lead. At least Adam seemed to have a good idea of how to navigate the situation.\r\n\r\n\"Then I have a message for Her Majesty, \" he said.\r\n\r\nHolding her tail still, Pandora tilted her head. \"Oh? Then send it, rogue. She will be entertained by what you have to say.\"\r\n\r\nI do not doubt that, Adam responded. Bill, repeat after me. Ready?\r\n\r\nHe nodded slowly. \"I am.\"\r\n\r\nTo the empress, I give you a warning.\r\n\r\nLifting his chin, Bill announced, \"To the empress, I give you a warning.\"\r\n\r\nFor it is true that my partner was a member of the Gray Rebellion.\r\n\r\n\"For it is true that my partner was a member of the Gray Rebellion.\"\r\n\r\nAnd against the Violet Throne…\r\n\r\n\"And against the Violet Throne…\"\r\n\r\nPresided over by the daughter of the dual suns…\r\n\r\n\"Presided over by the daughter of the dual suns…\"\r\n\r\nJust as we have on our home moon…\r\n\r\n\"Just as we have on our home moon…\"\r\n\r\nWe do indeed declare war.\r\n\r\n\"We do indeed declare war.\" He paused for a beat to think about what he had just said. When it finally sank in, he snapped a glance to the side. \"Wait, what?!\"\r\n\r\nSteven swiveled his head towards his companion. \"Bill, what are you doing?!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know!\" Bill hissed in response.\r\n\r\nBefore he had a chance to explain himself, his enemy pulled her feet under her and stood atop the ice mountain. Her eyes darkened, but otherwise, her expression was just as blank as ever.\r\n\r\n\"Is that your answer to Her Majesty, little one?\" she drawled. \"If that is the case, then my response on behalf of the empire is this.\"\r\n\r\nShe lifted a hand, made a swirling pattern in the air, and extended a long claw directly at Bill and Steven.\r\n\r\n\"Stop them by any means necessary, \" she stated.\r\n\r\nDark shapes lifted off the trees as one giant flock. The sky was practically obscured by them as far as Bill and Steven could see. At that point, the champion kept his blue-gray eyes to the sky as he addressed the researcher.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Bill. Ready?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not really.\"\r\n\r\nSteven shook his head and drew four poké balls – two for each hand – out of his pockets. \"Neither am I.\"\r\n\r\nBill glanced at his companion. \"Looks like we don't have a choice. Shall we, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's.\"\r\n\r\nAs the flock dove at them, Bill and Steven sprang in opposite directions, directly into the fight.",
