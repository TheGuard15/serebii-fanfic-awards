In the dim hours of that morning, a meteorite exploded over Siberian Russia. Modern scientists estimate that the energy had been equal to that of a thermonuclear bomb. Witnesses described it as a flash of blue light almost as brilliant as the sun. The shockwaves alone were enough to flatten over seven hundred square miles of forest. And the object itself? The size of two school buses end to end. Scientists called this the Tunguska event.\r\n\r\nIn order to picture what a meteor the size of one school bus could do, the logical action would be to divide everything by half. Take three hundred square miles of forest out of the Tunguska event. Dim the brilliant, blue light of the meteorite until it becomes a star half as bright as the sun. Imagine that the resulting air burst releases the energy equivalent to five hundred nuclear bombs instead of one thousand.\r\n\r\nOn September 27, 2000, almost one hundred years after the Tunguska event, that was exactly how scientists described the bus-sized meteor heading directly towards Earth.\r\n\r\nThe meteor in question was dubbed 2000 SE, and it came without warning. That in itself would have been unusual. There was astronomical equipment all over the world, and not one of them spotted an object of that size until it was almost as close as the moon. But that wasn\u2019t what grabbed the media\u2019s attention. What did was the fact that it was heading directly towards Earth, and with its speed, researchers estimated that it would reach the planet in four days. More specifically, it was heading to a point just outside of Fortree City.\r\n\r\nHoenn\u2019s regional government had never staged a full-scale evacuation of an entire city. Despite monsoons and the activity of two weather-altering legendaries, the region was never threatened significantly enough to warrant an evacuation of that magnitude. But it had to be done. Certainly, Fortree had survived far more earthquakes, storms, and general natural disasters than it should have, what with it being a city built entirely in the treetops, but the Japanese parliament wasn\u2019t going to assume that it would survive a meteor strike that close to its borders. So over the course of three days\u2014the three days before 2000 SE would pass through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere\u2014the entire city of Fortree took what it could and left.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth night, it turned out that the government was correct in their decision. Fortree was doomed.\r\n\r\nIt rained fire the night 2000 SE exploded, and the blasts emanating from its shattering masked the cracking of the forest that held the city aloft. Had anyone been in the city, they would never hear the screaming of the wood supports splintering. They would never hear the boom of their homes falling. They would never hear the crashing of glass or the screeching of bending metal. Not while the air resonated with the blast of the meteorite, anyway. Only when the resonance of the explosion died down, and only when the skies fell silent, did the last shrieks of the falling city echo through the night air.\r\n\r\nAnd then, there was silence.\r\n\r\nOutside of the city, beyond the red-hot craters that the meteorites carved out for themselves, there were two listeners. The first was an absol who stood guard at the Ancient Tomb with his red eyes to the sky. His pack had already been gone for days. Many of them had been part of the pok\u00e9mon exodus that started almost a week ago, long before the humans knew 2000 SE existed. Others stayed and tried to warn the humans, and this party departed after Fortree was finally evacuated. All that was left was the single absol, who had, up until the explosion, kept his red eyes to the sky and his teeth bared in a constant, low growl.\r\n\r\nIt was because he knew something else was going to happen. He could feel the cold, familiar weight of his premonitions in his bones, but for the life of him, he couldn\u2019t see what he was meant to warn the humans about. And then, when the star exploded and sent a shockwave of trembling earth and hot wind across the route, the absol braced himself against the tomb\u2019s rocky walls and gritted his teeth. The feeling in his bones grew heavier with each passing second until it reached a peak the moment the hot winds died down. His paws scrambled over the loose earth, and he raced down the hillside towards the craters. In his mind, his visions began to resolve, and all he could see was red.\r\n\r\nThe ground grew hotter as he drew closer to one of the impact craters, but he couldn\u2019t stop. His entire body was focused completely on that cold, heavy feeling deep inside him\u2014the feeling of his supernatural senses vibrating with his last vision. Any moment now, he would know. He would know exactly what message he needed to deliver.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, the ground almost ended beneath him, giving way to the red edge of a crater. He stopped, staring deep into the pit at the rock that sat at its heart. His muzzle snapped in frantic barks, and he paced along the rim. All the while, he steadied his eyes on the glowing, red surface of the meteorite. Every pit in its face, every imperfection in the stone made the feeling deep inside the absol grow until it filled his entire being. Something wasn\u2019t right. Something was about to happen. Something terrible was about to be born.\r\n\r\nThen, he saw what he came to see. His paws froze, and his mouth shut.\r\n\r\nA crack laced up the side of the meteor. At first, it was only an inch wide by a foot long, but then, it grew until it resembled a gaping smile turned sideways. The longer the absol stared at it, the more he realized that the glow was not coming from the surface of the rock but rather from within it, pulsing with every passing second like a heartbeat. This, the absol knew, was exactly what he was supposed to foresee. His lips puckered, and in that pause, he emitted a short, high-pitched whine.\r\n\r\nThat was when the meteorite cracked completely open and released the sea of red light. It rushed up the side of the crater before the absol could discern what it was, and within seconds, it washed over him.\r\n\r\nMiles away, the absol\u2019s pained howling echoed through the air, and the second listener raised her head.\r\n\r\nHer name was Phoebe, and she had just completed two weeks of training atop Mt. Pyre. Now, she was descending the mountain for supplies. She had no idea that the absol\u2019s howl was a warning.\r\n\r\nThat night, a war erupted because of her.", "award": 35, "member": 290212, "fic": 2, "link": null, "year": 2013}}, {"pk": 29, "model": "awards.nomination", "fields": {"comment": "", "nominee": null, "detail": "(spoiler)'s death in chapter 90", "award": 36, "member": 290212, "fic": 8, "link": null, "year": 2013}}, {"pk": 30, "model": "awards.nomination", "fields": {"comment": "", "nominee": null, "detail": "Tommy's return at the end of chapter 21", "award": 39, "member": 290212, "fic": 5, "link": null, "year": 2013}}, {"pk": 31, "model": "awards.nomination", "fields": {"comment": "", "nominee": null, "detail": "N shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don't know yet.

The Riolu seemed no worse for the wear. A few cuts were visible through his blue fur, the once bright azure color dulled with ground-in dust and blood, but he looked like he was functioning properly.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d Jay said with a cough. Leo didn\u2019t know how to answer him. He didn\u2019t rightly know how to explain the string of events that had transpired in the last few moments. \u201cIs everyone okay?\u201d Jay inquired, brushing himself off as the Riolu blinked in the blue sunlight.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think so,\u201d Leo replied. Looking around, he saw Noah getting up from the crater he had hunkered down in during the assault of the music, Jay was still getting oriented with his feet and limbs, and the monster was nowhere in sight. She had vanished. Though, there was something missing from this scene of aftermath.\r\n\r\n\u201cKelly?\u201d Leo blurted out when he did not see the yellow and white furred Jolteon at all. Jay ceased his complaints as he found he could not find his friend as well. \u201cKelly? Kelly!\u201d Leo yelled with increasing volume as he took a few steps in each direction looking for his teammate.\r\n\r\nThere was no sign of the Jolteon, despite her being literally a foot away from him before the Froslass\u2019s song. Both he and Jay fell dead silent as they tried to listen for any sound from her, though only the canyon walls screeched as wind tore through them, making his tail flame flicker. His blood turned to ice once again as the demented dungeon seemed to mock him, tempting him to venture deeper in search of his friend.\r\n\r\n\u201cKelly!\u201d Leo screamed to the passage, his voice straining as sheer panic took over. It was then that Noah jogged up beside both Pok\u00e9mon. The Dewott put a paw on both of their shoulders.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201d Leo felt something inside him collapse. Whether it was his soul or a lung from the Froslass\u2019s attack, he couldn\u2019t tell.\r\n\r\n\u201cGone? What do you mean ... gone?\u201d The Charmeleon\u2019s voice barely broke a hushed whisper as the cold wind blasted from the passage. The instinctively tightened muscles in his legs kept him from collapsing to the ground while his mind managed to keep a rein on his emotions to suppress his urge to sob.\r\n\r\n\u201cNoah, wh-where is Kelly right now?\u201d Jay asked, the Riolu trying in vain to mask his own emotions with a near monotone voice. The wind ceased, allowing the oppressive silence to once again rule this domain of altered sun and stone.\r\n\r\nNoah only shook his head in apparent defeat. \u201cShe\u2019s with Her now, probably about to be frozen alive. If I remember right, we have about ten minutes before she is added to Her ... collection.\u201d The Dewott looked up at the two remaining members of Salient, his face betraying no inner feelings or thoughts. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do now. If we\u2019re lucky, we can still get out of here while she\u2019s busy with Kelly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cN-nothing? What do you mean, \u2018there\u2019s nothing we can do\u2019, Noah?\u201d Leo demanded, his voice rising in volume. He knew perfectly well what it might mean. The Froslass had wanted me and I refused. And so she took the next best thing... His thoughts plainly told him, and for once, he knew he could trust them. It\u2019s all... He felt his heart drop again. It\u2019s all my fault she was taken.\r\n\r\nThe Dewott crossed his arms as he leaned against a pillar of glowing blue rock. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what it means. We can\u2019t do anything. She doesn\u2019t usually bother us when we travel through here, but on occasion, she will take one Pok\u00e9mon to her lair and freeze them solid,\u201d Noah answered nonchalantly as he tightened the strap on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow do you know this? Huh? How?\u201d Jay spoke up, his paws curling into fists as energy began to flow into them. Noah moved his paw down Jay\u2019s arm and pushed it down.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen it happen. Seven times. Watched them all freeze while Torrent ordered us to run for the exit. Trust me, seeing a Arcanine frozen alive oversteps the boundary of mentally scarring ten times over,\u201d he explained as Leo saw an involuntary shudder run down the Dewott\u2019s spine.\r\n\r\nLeo wasn\u2019t sure if it was the combined effects of everything that had happened to him over the last week, or his mind finally slipping past his damaged rational, but he felt a burning force of anger rise from his chest where his heart fell.\r\n\r\nHe had gone through too much: waking up, arrest, near death, hallucinations, exile, he could handle, but the notion of losing what was perhaps the only other being on this planet that could sympathise with him, it was impossible. He wouldn\u2019t let it happen.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Both Noah and Jay looked up from their argument at him. \u201cI\u2019ve gone too far with her, Jay, and even you, Noah, to lose any of you. My head may not be clear right now, but that is the one thing I am damn sure of. Noah, where is She, because I am going to tear Her to shreds,\u201d Leo snarled, a low, primal growl accompanying the statement.\r\n\r\n\u201cLeo, you don\u2019t understand: She will kill all of us if we don\u2019t leave. Kelly\u2019s probably already dead anyways, so let\u2019s just--\u201d Noah replied shortly before being cut off as Leo lunged at him. His reptillian body tackled the otter to the ground, shoving his head into the small, sharp rocks. Leo held the sharp edges of his claws against the Dewott\u2019s neck and pressed forward enough so that Noah would feel the pain. Jay crouched down next to the two, though didn\u2019t make any attempt to stop Leo\u2019s assault.\r\n\r\nLeo\u2019s chest was heaving, anger leaving a red mist in his eyes. He huffed a hot jet of steam from his nostrils as he leaned close to the pinned Dewott\u2019s face. His red scales glinting almost evilly in the stark, blue sunlight.\r\n\r\n\u201cShut up! Kelly will survive! She\u2019s strong enough! I know she will! Now, you are going to lead us to her, and then, you, Jay, and I are going to march right in there, burn Her goddamned liar to oblivion, and then rescue Kelly. Do you understand?\u201d Leo yelled, every thought of his bent suddenly on the destruction of the Froslass.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know? For once, I actually agree with one of your horrible ideas, Leo. Let\u2019s do this, \u201c Jay added as Noah gave a sigh of defeat.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou two are the most stupid, stubborn Pok\u00e9mon I\u2019ve ever met, and that\u2019s coming from me. I\u2019ll go, but I hope you know we\u2019re all going to die. Her \u2018pet\u2019 will make sure of that... \u201c Both Leo and Jay shot him confused looks as they wondered what he meant by his last sentence. Their questions were answered as a deep, feral-sounding roar shook the blue-stoned dungeon. Leo released his grip on the Dewott and climbed off of him, letting him get back to his feet with an annoyed huff.\r\n\r\nKelly, don\u2019t worry.

Hell, he stopped commenting on my chapters for so long that I stopped PM'ing him when I updated. But BAM, one day, right out of the blue he bombs right back in. Fully caught up, fully brilliant, and brings things to my attention that I hadn't even thought of. I'm giving Glover this nomination not because of a single review or even several, I'm giving it to him because he's a good person and a dedicated reviewer that I feel truly privileged to know. My fic was changed because of him.
